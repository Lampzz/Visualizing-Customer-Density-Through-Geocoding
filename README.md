# Visualizing-Customer-Density-Through-Geocoding
This project visualizes customer distribution through an interactive heatmap, offering valuable insights into customer density and geographic patterns. It leverages Python's **pandas* library for efficient data manipulation and the **requests* library to geocode customer addresses via the **Google Maps API**. The geocoded data is then plotted to analyze street-level trends, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions.

After converting customer addresses into latitude and longitude coordinates, the data was visualized using **Kepler.gl**, producing an engaging and insightful heatmap. This visualization highlights high-demand areas and supports strategic planning. The project demonstrates Python's powerful data processing and spatial analytics capabilities.
